## About The Project

This React Native project is created with the following stack :
- React Native
- Typescript
- Tailwind
- React Query

Improved code quality with ESLint and deployed to Expo App Store.

Note : This application was made using Binance Public API (I did not use the API provided by Pintu because one of the API that was provided cannot be accessed using my connection), if you are receiving an error in this application you might need to connect to a VPN to access the API.
